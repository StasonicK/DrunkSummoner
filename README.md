ABOUT THE GAME.
- You are the hero of the town enjoying your time in a bar!
- Your skill is to summon things from the void using arcane spells.
- You’ve gotten so good at it that you no longer need your spell book. Hell, you don’t even need to be sober.
- In fact, you can prove to all of them that you are capable of summoning drunk. You bet you can!
- Prove to the village folk that you are the best summoner this world has ever seen, because the world needs heroes who can enjoy a drink or ten while on the job!
